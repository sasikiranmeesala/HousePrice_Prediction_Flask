 In this project, I utilized web scraping on Makaan Website to gather valuable real estate data. Leveraging this dataset,
 I developed a robust regression model capable of predicting house prices. To make the insights accessible, I built a
 sleek frontend using the Flask framework. Led end-to-end deployment of a house price prediction project on AWS
 using Elastic Beanstalk and CodePipeline.
